            The Contractor may have had access to proprietary, private and/or
            otherwise confidential information ("Confidential Information") of
            the Recipient. Confidential Information shall mean all non-public
            information that constitutes, relates, or refers to the operation of
            the business of the Recipient, including without limitation, all
            financial, investment, operational, personnel, sales, marketing,
            managerial, and statistical information of the Recipient, and any
            and all trade secrets, customer lists, or pricing information of the
            Recipient. The nature of the information and the manner of
            disclosure are such that a reasonable person would understand it to
            be confidential. The Contractor will not at any time or in any
            manner, either directly or indirectly, use for the personal benefit
            of the Contractor, or divulge, disclose, or communicate in any
            manner any Confidential Information. The Contractor will protect
            such information and treat the Confidential Information as strictly
            confidential. This provision shall continue to be effective after
            the termination of this Agreement. Upon termination of this
            Agreement, the Contractor will return to the Recipient all
            Confidential Information, whether physical or electronic, and other
            items that were used, created, or controlled by the Contractor
            during the term of this Agreement.

            The Contractor acknowledges the Contractor's obligation to obtain
            appropriate insurance coverage for the benefit of the Contractor
            (and the Contractor's employees, if any). The Contractor waives any
            rights to recovery from the Recipient for any injuries that the
            Contractor (and/or the Contractors employees) may sustain while
            performing the Services under this Agreement and that are a result
            of the negligence of the Contractor or the Contractor's employees.

            has no right to act as an agent for the Recipient and has an
            obligation to notify any involved parties that it is not an agent of
            the Recipient.
